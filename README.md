# IrisesClassificationProblem
My first neural network ever written. Just a Linear Regression with ReLU activation function 
```
main.py - The Neural Network, it completes classification based on coefficients given from training.py
```

```
training.py - The realization of SGD meant to teach Network to determine which type of Irises is presented
